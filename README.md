## Experiments Under Consideration

Our project will be based on the paper: [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/conformer-based-target-speaker-automatic).


### Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition

This paper introduces the Conformer, a novel architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to achieve state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The Conformer aims to model both local and global dependencies of audio sequences in a parameter-efficient manner, leveraging the strengths of CNNs for local feature extraction and Transformers for capturing long-range global interactions.

**Conformer Model Architecture:**
- **Conformer Block:** Combines:
  - Two Macaron-style Feed-Forward Modules sandwiching other components.
  - Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) with relative positional embeddings for robust sequence modeling.
  - Convolution Module for efficient local feature extraction.
- The model processes input audio using a convolutional subsampling layer before feeding it into the Conformer blocks.
